    <section id="about">
        <p>Albert Einstein was a renowned theoretical physicist who is widely regarded as one of the greatest scientific minds in history. He was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, and passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, USA. Einstein's contributions to science, particularly in the field of theoretical physics, have had a profound and lasting impact on our understanding of the universe.</p>
        <p><b style="font-style: italic;">Fun Fact:</b> Einstein's brain weighed 1,230 grams, which is slightly smaller than the average human brain. But it was packed with some serious genius!</p>

                <h3><a href="https://users.physics.ox.ac.uk/~rtaylor/teaching/specrel.pdf" target="_blank">1. On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies</a> - (Published in 1905)</h3>
                <p>A groundbreaking paper that introduced the theory of special relativity. This paper revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and the speed of light. It introduced the concept of time dilation and the famous equation E=mc². Einstein proposed that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers and that the speed of light is always constant, leading to a new way of understanding the universe.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://iontrap.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WudkaGR-7.pdf" target="_blank">2. General Theory of Relativity</a> - (Published in 1915)</h3>
                <p>Einstein's theory that describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime. This groundbreaking paper introduced the theory of general relativity, which radically transformed our understanding of gravitation. In this theory, Einstein proposed that massive objects warp the fabric of spacetime, causing gravity. The paper also predicted phenomena like the bending of light by gravity, which was later observed during a solar eclipse, confirming the theory's validity.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://astro1.panet.utoledo.edu/~ljc/PE_eng.pdf" target="_blank">3. Photoelectric Effect</a> - (Published in 1905)</h3>
                <p>Explains the photoelectric effect and provides evidence for quantization of energy. This influential paper explained the photoelectric effect, where electrons are emitted from a material when exposed to light. Einstein's work showed that light is composed of discrete packets of energy called photons and that the energy of each photon is proportional to its frequency. This paper played a crucial role in the development of quantum mechanics.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/UG/SM/MATH3075/r/Einstein_1905.pdf" target="_blank">4. Einstein's Theory of Brownian Motion</a> - (Published in 1905)</h3>
                <p>Studied Brownian motion, supporting the existence of atoms and molecules. In this paper, Einstein explained Brownian motion, the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid. His work provided strong evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules, as the observed motion could be explained by the collisions of microscopic particles with larger ones. This paper was instrumental in confirming the atomic theory.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/einstein/1917_Radiation.pdf" target="_blank">5. On the Quantum Theory of Radiation</a> - (Published in 1917)</h3>
                <p>An exploration of the quantum theory of radiation. In this paper, Einstein contributed to the development of quantum mechanics by studying the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter. He introduced the concept of stimulated emission, which later became the foundation for the development of lasers. This work laid the groundwork for understanding the quantum behavior of light.</p>

                <p>Details the foundational principles of the general theory of relativity. In this comprehensive paper, Einstein outlined the mathematical framework and principles behind the general theory of relativity. He introduced the idea that massive objects cause the curvature of spacetime, which governs the motion of objects in gravitational fields. This paper provided the theoretical foundation for the study of black holes, gravitational waves, and the behavior of matter and light in strong gravitational fields.</p>
